Easily accept cryptocurrency payments on your WordPress site. Enable multiple currencies from the interconnected Cosmos ecosystem.


==  Description == 

The Cosmos Pay plugin allows you to accept cryptocurrency payments on your WordPress site. You can enable multiple currencies from the interconnected Cosmos ecosystem with just a few clicks. The plugin works with the Keplr Wallet Browser Extension, and any other wallet that supports the integrated cryptocurrencies.

An up-to-date list of current supported cryptocurrencies can be found on our [documentation website](docs.bitcanna.io/commerce/supported-assets).


## Installation

### Installing the Plugin

1. In your WordPress dashboard, choose `"Plugins > Add New"`.
2. Search for `"Cosmos Pay"` and select the plugin.
3. Click `"Install Now"`.
4. Click `"Activate"` to ready the plugin for use.

### Creating a Wallet

Requirements:

* A desktop computer 
* Google Chrome or Brave Browser
* WooCommerce

1. Install and add the Keplr Browser Extension to your browser. Launch the extension by clicking it in your extension bar (top-right).
2. Choose `"Create a new account"`. Make sure to save the seed phrase of your Keplr account in a safe place because your wallet is only recoverable through your seed phrase. We recommend backing up your seed phrase in at least 2 different locations, and not on your computer. BitCanna cannot access or recover your account.
3. In the `"account name"` field, you can choose the name for your account. It is a free text field, so it is possible to choose any name. Click `"Next"`.
4. You’ll now be asked to enter your seed phrase to check if you stored it correctly. When this is completed, click “Register”. You’ve now created your wallet!

### Setting up the Plugin

1. Now head back over to Wordpress and click `"WooCommerce"` in the left-hand menu, and then head to `"Settings"`. Head over to the `"Payments"` tab and locate `"Cosmos payments"` and click `"Manage"`.
2. On this page you can add a description, and choose the available cryptocurrencies to accept on your store. Don’t forget to click `"Save changes"` after you’re done editing.
3. Next up, click `"Cosmos Pay"` in the left-hand menu, and fill out your password to edit the settings.
4. Click `"Connect BitCanna"` (or up to as many blockchains you’d like to accept as currency) and approve the Keplr pop-ups to add the blockchain to Keplr, and to allow Wordpress to interact with your Keplr wallet. Your BitCanna address should be automatically filled out (or other addresses, depending which chains you connect). Don’t forget to click `"Save Changes"`!

That’s it. You’ve now successfully set up the Cosmos Pay plugin on your webshop!
